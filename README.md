# wheres-waldo-webvr
Set up a Unity project with Mozilla's WebXR exporter. The idea is that the player is surrounded by a sea of people and need to look around to find "Waldo", or the person they're looking for. This is mostly a sample project so I can learn WebVR! 

Installed Mozilla's WebVR Asset in Unity

Project is based off of Mozilla's sample project
